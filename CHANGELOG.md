# Changelog

## [9.12.0-beta4] - 2026-04-02

### ✨ Added

- Class Buff Reminder (Druid): Added party tracking for `Symbiotic Relationship`, so Druids now get reminded when the buff is missing.
- Group Frames (Healer Buffs / Mistweaver Monk): Added PTR prep for `Coalescence` (`1292922`), including a fallback icon so the spell can already be configured before the live spell data exists in Retail.
- Experience Bar: Added a `Current / Max (needed)` text option that shows the remaining XP to level as `max - current`.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Square Minimap / FarmHud: Hid the optional square minimap background while FarmHud is active so the FarmHud overlay is no longer tinted by the background panel.

---

## [9.12.0-beta3] - 2026-04-01

### ✨ Added

- Group Frames / Unit Frames (Name / Level): Added configurable `Frame strata` and `Frame level` settings for `Name` and `Level` text so overlapping can be resolved cleanly.
- Unit Frames (Boss): Increased the configurable boss-frame count up to `8`.
- Class Buff Reminder: Added an optional configurable border in Edit Mode .
- Square Minimap: Expanded the optional minimap styling with LSM border texture support, configurable border `size` / `offset`, and an optional background panel for shadow-style backdrops.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Group Frames / Resource Bars: Registered `PLAYER_SPECIALIZATION_CHANGED` as a player-scoped unit event so spec-switch updates stay scoped correctly.
- Unit Frames (Boss): Improved boss frame reliability in some encounters and fixed incorrect preview behavior in Edit Mode.

---

## [9.12.0-beta2] - 2026-03-31

### 🐛 Fixed

- Profile export/import missing specialization assignments on Unit Frame settings
- Actionbar labels missed to shorten `Backspace` and `Space`

---

## [9.12.0-beta1] - 2026-03-30

### ✨ Added

- Mythic+ (Combat Resurrection Tracker / Bloodlust Tracker): Expanded the tracker Edit Mode options with border, font, color, cooldown/charges text visibility and positioning, plus optional icon zoom.
- Unit Frames / Standalone Castbar: Added an optional cast-icon border with configurable color, LSM border texture, size, and offset.
- Data Panels (Item Level): Added a stream option to hide the average item level and show only the equipped item level in the panel text.
- Data Panels (Stats): Added per-stat options for `Mastery` and `Versatility` to hide the second percentage value and show only the primary percentage.
- Group Frames (Main Tank): Added an optional `Player first` setting so your own frame can stay at the front when you are assigned as a Main Tank.
- Group Frames (Private Auras): Added a `Text scale` setting so countdown and duration text can be made easier to read.
- Group Frames (Raid): Added per-group visibility toggles in Edit Mode so whole raid groups can be hidden when needed, for example bench/sub groups.
- Cooldown Panels: Added an `Ignore Masque` option for whole panels and, if needed, separately per entry.
- Cooldown Panels: Added vertical mirror options for state textures, including the second texture in double-texture setups.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Class Buff Reminder (Holy Paladin): Added tracking for `Beacon of Light` and `Beacon of Faith`. The reminder now behaves correctly in groups, counts self-casts properly.
- Cooldown Panels (Fixed Slots / Dynamic Subgroups): Fixed `TOP/BOTTOM + CENTER` subgroup anchoring to use true centered placement independent of fixed-slot.
- Cooldown Panels (Tracked Auras): Fixed heavy lag spikes caused by tracked-aura panels doing too much repeated refresh work in some situations.
- Cooldown Panels (Spells): Fixed some spell icons not dimming correctly after use.
- Group Frames (Main Tank / Private Auras): Raised the Main Tank private-aura size limit to `100`.
- Resource Bars (Spec Switch / Edit Mode): Fixed moved resource bars snapping back on `X` / `Y` after switching specs. Resource-bar positions now stay on their spec anchor settings instead of being overwritten by Edit Mode layout data.

---

## [9.11.0] - 2026-03-26

### ✨ Added

- Cooldown Panels (Fixed Slots / Dynamic Subgroups): Added configurable `Start point` and `Growth direction` options for dynamic subgroups.
- Cooldown Panels (Fixed Slots / Dynamic Subgroups): Added subgroup-wide `Icon X` / `Icon Y` offsets so grouped icons can be nudged together without moving every entry manually.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Container Actions: `Crystallized Ethereal Voidsplinter` (`240175`) is now always ignored by the container action button, so Catalyst-charge items no longer get queued there or trigger error messages.
- Groupframes: Smoothing wasn't working as expected
- Talent Reminder: Fixed dungeon-specific talent reminders not reliably triggering in some seasonal dungeons.
- Unit Frames (Target / Boss): Fixed the missing enemy-debuff filter option. Custom target and boss frames can now be switched between `Only my debuffs` and `All debuffs`, so teammate debuffs no longer stay hidden unintentionally.
- Group Finder (Mythic+ score panel): Reduced occasional Blizzard UI errors when opening or updating the score panel next to Group Finder and Raider.IO tooltips.
- Mythic+ (Chest Timers): Fixed the `+2` and `+3` timer labels overlapping each other next to the challenge timer. The labels now use a smaller font and stable relative anchoring so the vertical spacing stays consistent.
- Cooldown Panels (Fixed Slots / Layout Edit): Fixed moved icons in fixed-slot edit mode being hard to interact with. The visible shifted icon can now still be edited outside the panel area, while the ghost slot remains usable as an edit target.
- Group Frames (Party / Raid): Fixed absorb and heal-absorb overlays sometimes extending outside the frame, overlapping nearby group frames, or no longer filling correctly after the power bar was hidden.

---

## [9.10.0] - 2026-03-25

- Unit Frames (Player / Target / ToT / Focus / Boss): Fixed highlight borders not lining up correctly with the health bar.

---

## [9.9.4] - 2026-03-24

### 🐛 Fixed

- Missing locale

---

## [9.9.3] - 2026-03-24

### 🐛 Fixed

- Group Frames (Party / Raid / Edit Mode): Fixed the action buttons at the bottom of the settings panel using an uneven layout. They now use a consistent grid and the panel height behaves more cleanly when many options are visible.
- Group Frames (Party / Raid / Edit Mode): Fixed `Hover`, `Target`, and `Aggro highlight` borders not showing anymore, including their sample preview.

---

## [9.9.2] - 2026-03-24

---

## [9.9.1] - 2026-03-24

### 🐛 Fixed

- Group Finder (Party Keystone): Fixed party keystone sharing continuing in the background even while the option was turned off.

## [9.9.0] - 2026-03-24

### ✨ Added

- Shared Media: 6 new border assets in midnight style
- UI / Bars & Resources: Added a standalone `Total Absorb Tracker` for the player. It can be positioned in Edit Mode and supports custom icon, text, and border settings.
- UI / Nameplates: Added Blizzard default nameplate enhancements with aura click-through and optional enemy color coding by unit type, including configurable `Boss`, `Mini-boss`, `Caster`, `Melee`, and `Trivial` colors.
- Unit Frames (Player / Target / Focus): Added incoming heal bars to the regular unit frames. The feature can now be adjusted there just like on the group frames.
- Group Frames (Party / Raid): Added an optional `Aggro highlight` border in Edit Mode with `All` / `Only non-tanks` mode, sample preview, configurable texture/layer/size/offset, and adjustable color (default orange).
- Cooldown Panels (Spells): Added an optional `Hide when no resource` setting, so spells can stay hidden until you have enough resource again. This can be set for a whole panel or adjusted per entry.
- GCD Bar: Added an optional Blizzard `XPBarAnim-OrangeSpark` overlay that tracks the active fill edge, so the bar can be hidden for a spark-only look over resource bars.
- GCD Bar: Added a configurable `Frame strata` setting in Edit Mode, matching the standalone castbar layering controls and persisting correctly through Edit Mode hydration.
- Unit Frames (Target): Added `Show group number` unit-status settings to the target unit frame, matching the existing player-frame option set.

### 🔄 Changed

- GCD Bar: Lowered the minimum configurable bar height from `6` to `1`.
- Unit Frames / Group Frames (Aura max): Lowered the minimum configurable aura count to `1` for buff, debuff, and external displays, so boss and group frames can be limited to a single aura.
- Group Frames (Party / Raid): Improved the overall performance of group-frame updates, especially for custom raid sorting. Larger roster and layout updates should now feel noticeably smoother.
- Group Frames (Party / Raid): Made group-frame refreshes more stable during sort and roster changes, so frames keep their layout more reliably while the order updates in the background.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Group Finder (Raider.IO applicant link): Fixed the LFG applicant context-menu URL builder for cross-realm names so Raider.IO profile links no longer pick up the player's own realm, and skip link generation entirely when the applicant identity is secret.
- Group Finder (Applicants / secret values): Hardened applicant sorting, ignore highlighting, and applicant-cover tweaks against secret LFG data so raid listings no longer spam taint errors when Group Finder updates while restricted content is active.
- Gear & Upgrades (Equipment Flyout): Added a separate item-level position setting for equipment flyouts and stopped reusing the Character Frame `Outside` placement there, so upgrade/replace comparisons no longer end up in confusing off-slot positions.
- Unit Frames (Player): Fixed the player-frame name sometimes staying empty after login or loading screens by refreshing the label again when the EQoL frame is shown and once more after entering the world.
- Unit Frames / Group Frames: Main group anchors and secure headers are now clamped to the screen so moved layouts cannot be dragged off-screen as easily.
- Minimap (Instance Difficulty Indicator): Stopped overriding the Blizzard difficulty icon until the EQoL text-replacement option is actually enabled, and restore the default indicator correctly when that option is turned off again.
- Square Minimap / Instance Difficulty: Delves now show `D<tier>` (for example `D8`) on the minimap difficulty indicator instead of falling back to the full `Delves` label.
- Resource Bars (Warlock / Soul Shards): Fixed `Use custom color at maximum` getting stuck after entering dungeons because the Soul Shard max-value refresh could switch between raw and non-raw power ranges.
- Resource Bars (Runic Power / Maelstrom): Fixed protected Midnight values still using absolute threshold-color handling. Both resource types now use the percent-based secret threshold path instead of absolute threshold colors.
- Group Frames (Raid / Dynamic Scaling): Fixed `Level` text and `Group <number>` indicators growing with `Preserve content size`. Those two labels now keep their normal size while the slider still compensates the rest of the raid-frame content.
- Group Frames (Raid / Edit Mode Preview): Fixed grouped raid preview resolving against the current live raid subgroup layout instead of the requested sample size, so preview blocks now stay correct while already inside a raid.
- Questing & Cinematics (Quest Automation): Reverted the split auto accept / turn-in / gossip workflow after the new model proved unreliable. Quest automation now uses the previous combined `Automatically accept and complete quests` setting again, while keeping the Retail-compatible gossip selection path.
- Questing & Cinematics (Auto Gossip / Quest Turn-In): Fixed mixed quest-and-gossip NPCs immediately jumping into RP dialogue even while quest turn-in automation was off. Auto gossip no longer overrides quest interactions, and single-option gossip only auto-continues when no quest entries are present.
- Questing & Cinematics (Auto Accept / Turn-In): Fixed stale pending auto-accept quest state causing modifier-based quest turn-ins to close the quest frame instead of completing the hand-in, and leaving later quest interactions stuck in the same broken state.
- Questing & Cinematics (Auto Gossip Settings): Fixed the broken `Configured gossip IDs` picker causing Blizzard Settings type errors. Gossip IDs are now managed via `/eqol aag <id>` and `/eqol rag <id>` instead.

### ❌ Removed

- Dialogs & Confirmations: Removed the `Replace enchant` auto-confirm option because it could block enchant replacements instead of helping.
