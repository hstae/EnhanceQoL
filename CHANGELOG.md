# Changelog

## [10.9.0-beta2] - 2026-04-26

### ✨ Added

- Bags: Added a solid background color picker for the integrated Bags and Warband Bank frames.
- Data Panels / Combat Time: Added an option to show the boss timer above the combat timer when timers are stacked.
- Group Frames / Party: Added detachable Power Bar controls with global party-frame positioning, custom width, height, offsets, growth-from-center, strata, frame level, and optional detached border settings.
- Group Frames / Party: Added detachable Portrait controls with custom size, offsets, strata, and frame level, including smarter default placement based on party frame growth direction.
- Group Frames / Party: Detached portraits now support the existing Extend border over portrait behavior with a separate portrait border, while separator settings are disabled because detached portraits no longer use separators.
- Group Frames / Dispel Indicator: Added optional strata and frame level controls without changing the default indicator layering.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Bags: Improved text appearance handling so the integrated Bags and Warband Bank frames follow global font and font-style changes more reliably.
- Group Frames / Party: Fixed attached portraits expanding the layout anchor, which caused names, markers, and status icons anchored to TOPLEFT to use the portrait area instead of the original frame area.

---

## [10.9.0-beta1] - 2026-04-26

### ✨ Added

---

- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed Assisted Combat highlights appearing on hidden ghost icons used by fixed-layout bar entries.
- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed icon borders and other icon overlays appearing as empty boxes on hidden ghost icons used by fixed-layout bar entries.

---

## [10.7.0] - 2026-04-25

### ✨ Added

- Unit Frames / Focus Frame: Added Combat Indicator support to the Focus Frame.
- Unit Frames / Group Frames: Added an optional Blizzard aura rendering mode. This lets Blizzard render selected aura categories such as buffs, debuffs, defensives, dispels, and private auras directly, giving the same aura filtering and visibility behavior as the default Blizzard frames. It can be mixed with EnhanceQoL's custom aura rendering per category, but Blizzard-rendered categories intentionally offer less customization and focus on native frame parity.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Class Buff Reminder: Fixed food, flask, rune, and weapon buff reminders sometimes not showing for classes, such as Warlock, Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Monk, and Hunter.
- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed Blizzard Cooldown Manager aura bars so stack counts can be shown while using Cooldown bar mode.
- Unit Frames: Fixed the Player Frame name sometimes disappearing after login or reload until a font or outline setting was changed.
- Group Frames: Fixed party and raid frame growth directions sometimes turning into a stepped layout after profile or layout changes.
- Unit Frames / Group Frames: Fixed Blizzard-rendered aura borders so debuff frames scale correctly with the global Blizzard aura icon size.
- Unit Frames / Group Frames: Fixed Private Auras rendering behind party and raid frames by matching their layer to the regular aura containers.

---

## [10.6.5] - 2026-04-24

### 🐛 Fixed

- Data Panels: Fixed missing text color controls by adding panel-wide class/custom colors and Friends/Guild stream color options.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed panels anchored to unit frames sometimes using the wrong effective anchor after login, reload, or specialization changes until an anchor setting was toggled.
- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed old button charge text carrying over into BAR-mode charge entries after switching display modes.
- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed standalone bar borders so border size and offset no longer shrink, shift, or squash the bar fill texture.
- Group Frames / Healer Buff Editor: Fixed preview cooldown and charge text using unresolved global font-style settings, preventing `SetFont` errors when opening the editor with global font styling enabled.
- Square Minimap Stats: Fixed the default Tracking Button placement so new profiles start at the top-right corner instead of overlapping the mail icon at top-left.
- Unit Frames / Group Frames: Fixed hover highlight layering by adding Frame Strata controls, allowing borders to render above dispel overlays while hover highlights still render on top.

---

## [10.6.4] - 2026-04-24

### 🐛 Fixed

- Cooldown Panels: Fixed shared talent and capstone spell entries so they now switch more reliably to the correct active spell, no longer collapse unrelated active spells into one entry, and stay stable after `/reload`.
- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed bar fills sometimes drawing slightly outside their border.
- Group Frames: Improved name text stability on party and raid frames, reducing visible shaking when frames update, resize, or refresh their layout.
- Profiles / Fonts: Fixed global font and font-style propagation for the BR tracker, Total Absorb tracker, and target/focus buff text so they now update without manually switching fonts first.
- Unit Frames / Boss Frames: Fixed boss frames disappearing after resetting and re-pulling an encounter.
- Vendor: Fixed Auto Vendor selling cosmetic appearance items with vendor prices, including event-cache cosmetics.

---

## [10.6.3] - 2026-04-23

### 🐛 Fixed

- Cooldown Panels: Fixed some passive talent entries being treated like swappable talent-choice spells, which could incorrectly replace them with active spells such as `Temporal Anomaly`.
- Cooldown Panels / Keybinds: Fixed spell keybind resolution so talent and capstone entries no longer inherit bindings from unrelated spells through fuzzy spell lookups.

---

## [10.6.2] - 2026-04-23

### 🐛 Fixed

- Resource Bars: Fixed the Devorer Void Meta bar so it now fills correctly while in Void Meta and no longer looks empty after you go past the cast threshold.
- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed BAR-mode entries in keybind-enabled panels so hidden source icons no longer leave behind floating keybind.

---

## [10.6.1] - 2026-04-23

### 🐛 Fixed

- Cooldown Panels: Fixed shared panels with talent-choice spells so entries like `Divine Toll` / `Holy Prism` or `Tremor Totem` / `Poison Cleansing Totem` now switch to the correct spell for the current spec and talent choice without disappearing or getting stuck on the wrong icon.
- Profiles: Fixed profile export/import so the Mover on/off setting is now included.

---

## [10.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### ✨ Added

- Group Frames: Added "Don't overflow health bar" controls for Absorb and Heal Absorb bars in the Party/Raid panels, plus an optional Absorb glow indicator. Absorb no-overflow is available with reverse fill; Heal Absorb no-overflow is available without reverse fill.
- Cooldown Panels: Added an Original Blizzard icon border option, matching the rounded Cooldown Manager look for panel icons.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Cooldown Panels: Polished the Original Blizzard icon border so the frame, icon, and cooldown swipe line up more cleanly.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed Ready Glow sometimes disappearing or failing to appear after a cooldown finished, especially when the global cooldown briefly overlapped the spell.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed "Require resource for ready glow" so Ready Glow no longer appears while a spell is not currently usable, such as `Rampage` without enough Rage or `Execute` outside its usable conditions.
- Party/Raid Frames: Fixed the Dispel indicator highlight so it now covers the full frame, including the resource bar, and the Edit Mode sample stays visible.
- Party Frames: Fixed role-based Power Bar visibility in solo scenarios so the current specialization role is used when no party role is assigned.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed panels for other specializations sometimes staying visible after switching specs.

---

## [10.5.2] - 2026-04-22

### 🐛 Fixed

- Action Bars: Ignored stale or invalid custom border texture paths from SavedVariables so old profile data can no longer render action buttons as solid black blocks.
- Profiles / Fonts: Guarded remaining tracker and bar font applications so global font-style SavedVariables are resolved before calling `SetFont`.

---

## [10.5.1] - 2026-04-22

### 🐛 Fixed

- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Added a duration toggle for Charge bars. Active Charge timers now render through Blizzard's native cooldown text and segmented Charge handoffs use native cooldown completion callbacks instead of spellcast polling.
- Minimap / Instance Difficulty: Read Delve tier text from Scenario Header widgets when Blizzard's Gossip tier API is absent, restoring normal Delve tiers and Nemesis Delve `?` / `??` labels.
- Mythic Plus / BR & Bloodlust Tracker: Clamped the live tracker buttons to the screen and immediately reset offsets when users change external anchor targets, so Party/Raid anchored trackers land on the intended frame.
- Unit Frames: Raised the default render strata for detached Power and Secondary Power bars so the health-frame border no longer overlaps them.

---

## [10.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### ✨ Added

- Group Frames / Externals: External cooldown icons can now show a glow, with color, style, and offset controls to make important external defensives easier to spot.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Profiles / Fonts / SharedMedia: Fixed invalid or missing LibSharedMedia font assets causing `FontString:SetFont(): Invalid font file asset` errors when profiles reference fonts that are not installed locally.
- Resource Bars / Essence: Temporarily disabled use of Blizzard's `GetPowerRegenForPowerType` for Essence prediction while the API is secret-only in current Retail builds.
- Tooltips: Added secret-value guards for unit identity lookups to avoid `UnitName(unit)` errors on secret tooltip units.
- Minimap / Instance Difficulty: Guarded the removed `C_GossipInfo.GetActiveDelveGossip` Delve tier API so Delves fall back to `D` instead of throwing an error.

---

## [10.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### ✨ Added

- Mythic Plus / BR & Bloodlust Tracker: Added tracker icon choices and grouped Bloodlust Edit Mode options into collapsible sections.
- Cooldown Panels: Added direct panel settings inside the panel dialog, including panel name, enabled state, spec filters, and quick role-group choices.

### 🔄 Changed

- Cooldown Panels: Reworked Layout Edit so panel controls open directly next to the editor, selected entries show their settings immediately, and panel layout editing no longer needs the normal Edit Mode button.
- Cooldown Panels: Simplified the editor layout with a compact drop area, smaller manual add row, and cleaner entries list without repeated fixed subgroup labels.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Unit Frames: Fixed boss-frame Edit Mode previews after reloads, restored frame highlights after dungeon or raid transitions, and restored the target-frame combat icon.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed Blizzard Cooldown Manager aura icons not always resyncing after cooldown viewer frame reassignments, which could hide tracked panel icons until a later refresh.
- Cooldown Panels / Bars: Fixed separated stack bars so separated offset creates real bordered segments, matching Resource Bars segment rendering.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed new panels and bar entries defaulting to an explicit `Outline` font style instead of the global font-outline setting.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed cursor-anchored panels being difficult to configure from Layout Edit.
- Mythic Plus / Teleport Compendium: Fixed the World Map Teleport Compendium tab sometimes disappearing after finishing a dungeon or raid until the UI was reloaded.
- Minimap / Instance Difficulty: Fixed the instance difficulty indicator not always updating its displayed group size after raid members left a flex instance.

---

## [10.3.2] - 2026-04-20

### 🐛 Fixed

- Cooldown Panels / Performance: Reduced addon memory usage and improved overall performance by cleaning up oversized stored panel data.
- Unit Frames / Incoming Heals: Fixed overlay layering so incoming-heal prediction now renders above absorbs again.
- Nameplates / Default Nameplate Coloring: Fixed rare, rare elite, and world boss enemies not always using the configured nameplate colors.
- Cooldown Panels / Strata: Fixed panel handle strata handling.
- Mythic Plus / BR & Bloodlust Tracker: Fixed buggy tracker positions when anchored to Cooldown Panels by reapplying the tracker anchor after the target panel finishes positioning.
- Unit Frames / Follower Dungeons: Fixed spec-based Unit Frames profile switching not always updating when queueing as a different role/spec than the current one.
- Cooldown Panels / Borders / SharedMedia: Fixed a regression where icon borders were not re-applied after `/reload` when using externally registered SharedMedia borders.

---

## [10.3.1] - 2026-04-19

### 🐛 Fixed

- Unit Frames / Status Text: Fixed `Ghost` showing twice on unit frames when both health text and status text were enabled.
- Cooldown Panels / Edit Mode: Reduced lag when opening Edit Mode and `/ecd`. Cooldown Panels now stay almost completely outside of Blizzard Edit Mode and only use it where cursor-based placement still needs it.

---

## [10.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### ✨ Added

- Profiles / Fonts: Added global font and font-style controls, including mass-apply actions for full profiles, and added support for the new font-style system in Data Panels / Combat Text.
- UI / Frames: Added `Hide Event Toasts`.
- Unit Frames: Added absorb-based health-text formats, raised the configurable aura-icon size cap to `120`, and added the missing `Hide in pet battles` Edit Mode option to the Player Frame.
- Resource Bars / Shared Mode: Added optional `Classic` / `Shared` modes per specialization with shared slot layouts, shared anchoring, Edit Mode support, export/import support, and per-power styling overrides.
- Data Panels: Added a per-panel tooltip direction setting.
- Nameplates / Default Nameplate Coloring: Added customizable `Neutral`, `Threat warning`, and `Threat lost` health-bar colors.
- Cooldown Panels / Stances: Added `Shadowform` for Priest stance tracking.

### 🔄 Changed

- Mouse / Ring: Enabled opacity control across the mouse ring color settings.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Data Panels / Stats: Adapted the stats stream for WoW `12.0.5` secret-value restrictions and restored the primary stat display through Blizzard's specialization-based lookup.
- Unit Frames / Cast Bar: Fixed cast-icon border taint and layering issues, and fixed castbar gradients being tinted by the base castbar color while gradients are enabled.
- Group Frames: Fixed stale disconnected indicators after reconnects or reloads, and fixed party-frame names still shaking on the initial login when using non-top/non-bottom name anchors.
- Party/Raid Frames / Status text: Fixed the font outline setting getting stuck on `Outline`.
- Party Frames / Externals: Fixed `outside` anchoring and center alignment when portraits extend the visual frame width.
- Vendor / Baganator: Fixed missing sell and destroy markers, restored the destroy button, and reduced lag spikes when opening the bank from the inventory button.
- Pet Frame: Fixed the pet frame sometimes staying visible without an active pet when a visibility condition was configured.
- Combat Resurrection / Bloodlust Tracker: Fixed Edit Mode anchor restoration, text layering, and anchored positions after login or reload.
- Resource Bars / External Backdrop: Fixed preview and Edit Mode desync issues.
- Focus Interrupt Tracker: Fixed missing Warlock interrupt entries and erratic Edit Mode positioning.
- Group Frames / Healer Buffs: Added the missing `Ebon Might` aura ID `395296` so the buff is tracked correctly.
- Cooldown Panels / Proc Glow: Fixed action-button overlay glows getting stuck after spell-override swaps such as Demon Hunter `Metamorphosis`.

### ❌ Removed

- Data Panels / Stats: Removed `Versatility` from the stats stream for WoW `12.0.5`, because the updated stat APIs now require secret-protected arithmetic that addons can no longer safely perform.
- Character Frame / Stats: Temporarily removed the custom `Movement Speed` stat and custom stat-row formatting on the character stats pane for WoW `12.0.5`, because Blizzard now treats parts of the PaperDoll stats flow as secret-value protected.

---

## [10.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### ✨ Added

- Edit Mode / Anchoring: Combat Resurrection Tracker, Bloodlust Tracker, Standalone Private Auras, Combat Text, and Total Absorb Tracker can now be anchored to the same supported UI elements as Cooldown Panels.
- Group Frames / Party & Raid: Added an `Anchor to` option in Edit Mode so party and raid frames can be attached to other supported UI elements instead of only the screen.
- Unit Frames / Cooldown Viewer Anchoring: Player, party, and raid frames can now be anchored directly to the original Blizzard Cooldown Manager viewers, including `EssentialCooldownViewer`, `UtilityCooldownViewer`, and `BuffIconCooldownViewer`.
- UI / Bars & Resources: Added `Frame strata` and `Frame level offset` settings for resource bars, with the same layering applied consistently to borders, absorb overlays, and segmented resource elements.
- Unit Frames / Player Highlight: Added a separate `Highlight in combat` toggle with its own combat highlight color.
- Action Bars: Added anchor and X/Y offset controls for `Charges/Stacks` and `Keybinds` when their text override settings are enabled.
- Data Panels / Coordinates: Added a precision setting for the coordinates stream, so displayed coordinates can use `0`, `1`, or `2` decimal places.
- Map Navigation / Instance Difficulty: Added an `Anchor` setting for the Minimap difficulty text, so it can align to Minimap points like `TOPLEFT`, `TOP`, or `TOPRIGHT` and be adjusted with `x/y` offsets.
- UI / Interface: Added a `Custom` UI-scale option with a numeric input, so any value between `0.1` and `2` can be entered instead of only using fixed presets.
- Health Macro: Added `Refreshing Serum` to the combat potion pool so the macro can use it on the shared combat potion cooldown.
- Sound: Added a mute toggle for the `Gaze of the Alnseer` trinket under `Trinkets`.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Group Frames / Party & Raid: Fixed `Frame texture` selections using `Use health/power textures` resetting to `SOLID` after reload.
- Pet Frame: Fixed the pet frame sometimes staying visible even without an active pet when a visibility condition was configured.
- Group Frames / Auras: Fixed aura stack counts rendering behind custom aura borders, aura tooltips blocking clicks on party and raid frames, and debuff sub-filters hiding too many harmful auras.
- Group Frames / Auras: Restored the previous layering so party and raid buffs and debuffs stay above role icons and raid markers again.
- Group Frames: Reduced pixel-snapping jitter on party frame text, including player names and centered health or level text.
- Group Frames / Party: Fixed switching UF profiles in Delves and similar party-instance content with `Show Player` enabled sometimes throwing Lua errors and stretching the party frame to full screen height.
- Group Frames / Health: Fixed `Smooth fill` not animating party and raid health bars, so the setting works again instead of behaving the same in both states.
- Group Frames / Healer Buffs: Added the missing `Ebon Might` aura ID `395296` so the buff is tracked correctly.
- Unit Frames / Cast Bar: Fixed cast icon borders sometimes triggering a `Backdrop.lua` secret-number taint error and restored proper rendering for non-`SOLID` SharedMedia borders.
- Unit Frames / Visibility: Fixed `Show when Skyriding` and `Show when Flying` sometimes keeping unit frames visible while dead or flying as a ghost.
- Unit Frames / Status Text: Fixed `Group number font` on player and target frames using the regular status text font instead of its own dedicated font setting.
- Combat Resurrection Tracker / Bloodlust Tracker: Fixed anchored positions and anchor restoration after login or reload so the frames no longer fall back to the top-left corner.
- Focus Interrupt Tracker: Fixed missing Warlock interrupt entries so `Spell Lock` and `Axe Toss` are tracked correctly.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed some spells occasionally showing a global cooldown swipe or timer when they should not.
- Cooldown Panels: Fixed talent-choice spell variants collapsing too aggressively onto their base spell, so legitimate combinations such as `Wild Charge` with `Dash` can be tracked together while mutually exclusive variants still deduplicate correctly.
